# Lotti_Karotti / Funny Bunny 

-----
The playing cards for the game do not have to be drawn manually, but are displayed in random order in the app.
The motivation was to facilitate play for underage children.

The advantage of this automation would also be that one would be able to determine the ratio among the cards by copying the "cards" (images) at pleasure / wish. The playing cards were photographed and the background was removed in order to improve online viewing.
